      <b>Fun fact about myself?</b>
      A fun fact about me, is my entire education history. I got my first college credits at age 12 
      through a CLEP test. <br>
      I am planning to graduate with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science before I turn 19. 
      I am currently 16 and have 50ish credits.
       <br> <b>Why did I choose CS?</b>   <br>
      I chose computer science because I have always had a fascination with computers, and my 
      dad also does computer science related stuff for his job. <br>
       <b>What do I want to do once I graduate?</b> <br>
       I would like to spend some time travelling and just having fun with friends, and then 
       get a job (either as a web devloper or other kind of programmer) and put my degree to use.
